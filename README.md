# svtfoe_collateraldamage
Cracking the cryptogram in collateral damage:
The Python programs attached take the nth letter/word out of certain permutations of the letter from the episode "Collateral Damage."
Give them a spin. 3, 7, and 10 are regarded as significant numbers, but you can try other numbers.
The UI version is meant to be opened with the normal Python command line, and can be used from there.
The non-UI version is for those with some experience of Python. I didn't want to include every new permutation of the letter in the UI version, so I was lazy and just edited the code directly for each new idea I had. Open in the IDLE editor.
Keep in mind I'm an amateur programmer (see: read a few chapters of a book)
I didn't include certain failsafes, so the programs might close unexpectedly. Just open it again, or redownload it if that doesn't work.
You can try adding your own strings and lists to the code, just please upload as a separate file.
This is my first time using GitHub also so idk what I'm doing let me know if you have any problems.
